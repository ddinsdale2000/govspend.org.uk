<h1>G-Cloud News</h1>

<h2>20th March 2014 - G-Cloud Spend to end of February 2014</h2>
<p>Spend for Jan and Feb 2014 has now been included.</p><p>Highlights are:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Impressive growth - G-Cloud spend per month (£16m in Jan 2014) is now more than twice that of the entire year in 2012 (£7m)</li>
<li>Spend in February was £13.4m.  Expect this to be revised upwards when the March 2014 data is released (our guess to about £16m).</li>
<li>Total spend is £124m with almost £30m in 2014  (£87m being in 2013, £7.1m in 2012).</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread of the framework</p>
<ul>
<li>22 new customers joined the framework this month (bringing the total to 380).</li> 
<li>24 new suppliers joined the framework this month (bringing the total to 273).</li> 
</ul>
<p>Forecasts</p>
<ul>
<li>Spend is building strongly.  The framework is adding 20 to 30 new buying organisations each month.</li>
<li>It is likely that that spend will top £20m a month by summer and be around £30m a month by year end.</li>
<li>Because of the strong start to 2014, we have increased our forecast for 2014 to £200m.  </li>
</ul>
