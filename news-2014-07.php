<h1>G-Cloud News</h1>


<h2>26th August 2014 - G-Cloud Spend to end of July 2014</h2>
<p>Spend for July 2014 has now been included.  Highlights are:</p> 



<p><b>Overall spend stats</b></p> 

<ul>
<li>Total spend is £249m with £154m so far in 2014  (£87m being in 2013, £7.1m in 2012).</li><br>
<li>Spend with Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) continues at pace.  We expect spend with SMEs for 2014 to be over £130m, compared to £42m in 2013.  SME spend to date in 2014 is £88m (57% of total spend).</li> <br>
<li>Spend in July is £21m.  We expect this figure to be revised upwards to about £25m when the August figures are released. </li><br>   
</ul>


<?php
//<p>Is government enhancing supplier diversity? It seems so.  The organisations that have engaged more than 10 suppliers via G-Cloud are:</p>
//<ul>
//<li>Cabinet Office - 57 suppliers</li>
//<li>Home Office - 56 suppliers</li>
//<li>MoJ - 37 suppliers</li>

//</ul>
?>


<p><b>Spread of the framework</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The number of customers continues to grow strongly - up 27 in July (bringing the total to 551).</li> <br>
<li>The number of suppliers is growing - up 23 in July (bringing the total to 366).</li> 
</ul>
<p><b>Forecasts</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We are holding our forecast for 2014 at £250m, however, this figure is looking under pressure - £280m is possible if growth continues. </li><br>
<li>The trend figure for spend is now £24m.  It topped £20m a month for the first time in April and continues to grow at about £1m a month.  
  We expect average monthly spend to increase to roughly £30m a month by year end.</li><br>
