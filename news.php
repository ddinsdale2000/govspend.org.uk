<li>Spend in November was £10.5m.</li>
<li>Spend in October was revised upwards from £7.0m to £9.8m.</li>
<li>There is a trend of upward revision of previous months data - expect Nov to be revised upwards in Jan.</li>
<li>Total spend is £77.8m with £70.7m being in 2013 (£7.1m in 2012).</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread of the framework</p>
<ul>
<li>21 new customers joined the framework this month (bringing the total to 336).</li> 
<li>13 new suppliers joined the framework this month (bringing the total to 212).</li> 
</ul>
<p>Forecasts</p>
<ul>
<li>We forecast the first £10m month this year, delighted to report that November was the first £10m+ month.</li>
<li>We have increased the forecast spend for 2013 from £75m to £80m</li>
<li>We have increased the forecast spend for 2014 to £150m.  Based on growth rates in both spend and the number
 of organisations using the framework, £200m+ would not be a surprise in 2014 and £250m suddenly seems possible.</li>
