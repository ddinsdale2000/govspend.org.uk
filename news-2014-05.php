<h1>G-Cloud News</h1>

<h2>13th June 2014 - G-Cloud Spend to end of May 2014</h2>
<p>Spend for May 2014 has now been included.</p><p>Highlights are:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Total spend is £191m with £97m so far in 2014  (£87m being in 2013, £7.1m in 2012).</li><br>
<li>Spend with Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) continues at pace.  We expect spend with SMEs for 2014 to be over £130m, compared to £42m in 2013.  SME spend in 2014 is £61m.</li> <br>
<li>Spend in May was £12m. This is below trend; we think that the reason is mostly a timing issue.  
Last month, spend was reported at £16m and then revised upwards this month to £20m.  
Cabinet Office has started to release data earlier in the month and we think some suppliers struggle to make the earlier reporting deadline.</li><br>
<li>The new Digital Services Framework (DSF) is impacting Lot 4 spend - we are starting to see agile development services move to DSF from g-cloud.  
This is expected and is part of Government's strategy.  'Agile' spend has been comfortably over £1m a month since October 2013.  Last month (April) it was £913k and this month (May) £565k.</li><br>
</ul>

<?php
//<p>Is government enhancing supplier diversity? It seems so.  The organisations that have engaged more than 10 suppliers via G-Cloud are:</p>
//<ul>
//<li>Cabinet Office - 57 suppliers</li>
//<li>Home Office - 56 suppliers</li>
//<li>MoJ - 37 suppliers</li>
//<li>Defra - 21 suppliers</li>
//<li>DoH - 14 suppliers</li>
//<li>DfE - 13 suppliers</li>
//<li>HMRC - 12 suppliers</li>
//<li>Maritime & Coastguard Agency - 12 suppliers</li>
//<li>BIS - 11 suppliers</li>
//<li>FCO - 10 suppliers</li>
//</ul>
?>

<p>Spread of the framework</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of customers continues to grow strongly - up 43 last month and 18 this month (bringing the total to 491).</li> <br>
<li>The number of suppliers is growing, but more slowly than the customer base - up 12 last month and 10 this month (bringing the total to 322).</li> 
</ul>
<p>Forecasts</p>
<ul>
<li>We have revised our forecast for 2014 to £250m (up from £200m). </li><br>
<li>Spend is building strongly and the number of organisations buying from the framework is growing.</li><br>
<li>The trend figure for spend topped £20m a month for the first time in April.  We expect average monthly spend to increase to £30m a month by year end.</li><br>
</ul>
